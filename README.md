# ls8-emulator

The LS8 is a fictitious 8-bit microcomputer with 8-bit addressing, allowing for 256 bytes of RAM.

See the instruction set [specifications](LS8-spec.md) to get a better idea as to what this microcomputer can do.

## Notable features

-   Hardware stack using a stack pointer register. SP starts at 0xF3 and grows downward

-   Support for hardware interrupts (max of 8 interrupts) via dedicated interrupt status register, an interrupt mask register (to enable / disable servicing), and an IVT located in memory between the addresses of 0xF8 - 0xFF.

-   Dedicated 1 second timer interrupt built-in

-   Support for additional devices (through direct memory acces). Included in the python-app is a simplistic "keyboard" device. Reads terminal (non-blocking) and writes single chars to memory at address 0xF4
